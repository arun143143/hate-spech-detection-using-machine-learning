### Hate_Detection_Models.ipynb
* Extract features to get word counts, frequency of word counts, uni-grams and bi-grams
* Train Models for two and three labels respectively
* Compute Accuracy, Precision score, Recall score and F1 score for each of the models
* Uses Keras with Tensorflow backend

### Hate_Detection_Results.ipynb
* Plot the different metrics obtained to compare scores
* Plot the different metrics to compare results of other existing appraoches

### Hate_Detection_ROC_Curves.ipynb
* Plot the ROC Curves for all models for two label classification
